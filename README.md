### Technoverse Hackathon 

<h1>Project title: Legal Help</h1>

<p>Project Track : Web development</p>
<p> Tech stack used: 
<li>NextJs</li>
<li>TailwindCss</li>
<li>NextAuth</li>
</p>


<p>I would recommend view the hosted site as setting the env file would be time consuming. View the website:<p>

<h1>Setting up the project</h1>
<p> 1.clone the repo </p>
<p> 2.Enter into the dir
``` cd LEGAL-HELP    ```
</p>
<p> 3. Download dependencies   ``` npm i```</p>
<p> 4. Since the Legal help uses discord authentication , you would have to generate DISCORD_CLIENT_ID and DISCORD_CLIENT_SECRET from discord developer portal . If steps are unclear watch this <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RP0P_zGdvj8'> Video</a>
